# Product moisture prediction
Time Series Machine Learning based Prediction Model to achieve consistent Product Moisture in manufacturing.

# Problem statement
Achieving consistency in product quality is one of the key objectives in a manufacturing. In case of a hygroscopic organic product, moisture plays a vital role in determining the end product quality.

The manufacturing process of this product has a drying step which is controlled to get the end product moisture within limits. The incoming material loses moisture in the drying process. The product moisture changes from the desired value of 13.5+/-0.3%.

 Building a time series machine learning model to predict Ex- Dryer moisture set point will help to achieve Ex-Packing moisture within 13.5+/-0.3% with maximum accuracy.
